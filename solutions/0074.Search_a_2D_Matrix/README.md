## 74. Search a 2D Matrix

### Problem Link 
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/

### Note
This problem is very similar to find a value in a sorted list, however, here is a sorted matrix.

We can surely flatten the matrix to list then use `binary search`.

Also, we can directly `binary search` on matrix. The only thing need to be noticed is to find correct corresponding
 `mid` index value.
